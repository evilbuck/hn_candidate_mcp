I do a lot of programming, usually in Python and C++, and with a mathematical or algorithmic focus. For example, as part of my research I developed a BDD library that uses complexity theory to guarantee correctness with small overhead. Or recently, in my spare time, I created an AI for MTG (drafting, to be precise), using a transformer architecture with PyTorch. I am very enthusiastic about using or coming up with theoretical ideas that can improve outcomes in practice. I rely on having strong fundamentals, from mathematics over algorithms to knowledge of the actual hardware, to enable me to easily pick up new areas and tackle novel problems. Most of my research is the result of collaborations \u2014 it is important to me to both support my colleagues and be able to learn from them.Please feel free to refer to my CV for more detailed information, or my website (https://nicze.de/philipp/). Currently, I am very interested in AI, but I am also happy to discuss any other interesting opportunities!reply",

You\u2019ve got early revenue, a growing user base, and real traction, but no time to keep talking to users. You\u2019ve outgrown founder-led support, and now you need someone to own everything user-facing.I\u2019m that person.At Pythagora (YC W24), I was the first customer hire. I built DevRel, support, docs, demos, community, and launch content from zero. I set up systems to pull user insights from Discord, GitHub, Reddit, and email and turned that into product direction. I ran influencer campaigns, launched features, and shipped full-stack demo apps to tell the product story.Before that, I spent 7 years at Streak (YC S11), leading technical support, building internal tooling in SQL, Zapier, and BigQuery, and working closely with the founders to guide product.I'm also a software engineer. I\u2019ve built internal tools, demo apps, and full-stack open-source projects, including a deploy preview framework I documented in a full technical case study.Looking for a small, sharp team with early traction, ideally post-launch with signs of real user pull, but still pre-scale.

I have worked in different types of environments: from small, start-up-like, to medium-sized (~100-200 engineers), to big-corporation (~2000 engineers). I've built systems from scratch and scaled large distributed systems handling millions reqs/s. As a result, I have both the practicality and adaptivity of a start-up developer, and the awareness of scale, reliability and process of a software engineer.I read extensively and learn systematically, not only software engineering but also a wide range of other subjects. My portfolio (https://portfolio.hungcq.com) showcases side projects driven by curiosity and a deep interest in learning. I enjoy exploring the full stack, experimenting with technologies such as the clouds, workflow engine, service mesh and observability stacks, ML, and LLMs.(I think) I'm up for any challenge. I'm ambitious, I'm confident in myself.

I was the maintainer of Truffle Debugger (https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/develop/package...), a Solidity smart contract debugger, for 5 years. I eventually ended up writing my own decoding and encoding libraries to support it, as well as a bunch of other things.I'm good at this sort of nitpicky work, spotting and thinking about edge cases. I like getting things exactly right, even though that obviously isn't always possible due to various constraints. I've been kind of wondering if I should get into embedded development; I find it appealing when things are low-level or similarly constrained. I've beaten Microcorruption. :) (The original levels, I haven't played the new ones.)I'm also quite interested in unusual or obscure data formats, and working on Truffle Debugger and its associated libraries certainly involved a bunch of having to figure undocumented formats and interfaces. :) I put down above what languages I've worked substantially in but I'd say I'm a generalist and will figure out whatever you give me (I knew approximately no Javascript, Typescript, or Solidity when I started working at Consensys).I'm a mathematician by background and in my spare time, so after the Truffle Debugger project was shut down I took some time off to focus on my mathematical projects. But now I'm looking for work again! If you need someone like me, I'm available for hire!reply",

That said, I'm willing to consider a position with a great fit for my skill set and career goals.Here's my pitch: I have experience in a multitude of industries and positions. From improving legacy infra and processes in an established telco company to scaling a fast-moving startup from 200K to 2M users. In my free time, I love writing Code That Is Poetry but day-to-day I am not an idealist engineer who doesn't compromise. Well-engineered code is clean and correct but correct above all else.Oh, also, I'm great at writing documentation. I consider myself introverted but apparently my communication skills are above average for Software Engineers. I also pride myself on my humility and modesty.I'm currently a backend engineer developing features and improving infra for an online game with millions of daily active users. I'd love to explore other technical positions in the games industry short of joining a AAA studio because (a) I don't want to crunch and (b) my skill set does not lay that way; other tech-creative industries would also appeal to me! Another particular interest is in B2C businesses where the 'C' is software developers. I'd love to chat and network about opportunities; if you think you have a product that could benefit from my skill set, drop me a line!reply",

I'm open to consider companies of all sizes, but my preference is a company at series B or later that has product/market fit and is looking to scale the business, improve reliability and implement best practices.I'm a long-time HN member with almost 9000 karma/points, but posting on a new account to maintain some degree of anonymity for my primary account.reply",

Too often an API is designed by exposing the internals of whatever system provides the API. My philosophy is the opposite: start with the apps. I like to build a series of sample apps before starting on the API. This way I can imagine what API will make those apps and others like them easy to build.\u2022 Talk with users! I don't like to sit in a back room cranking out code. I want to make sure it's the right code for what my users need, and that it's easy to maintain and improve as we learn more about what they want.Open to full time or contract.I look forward to talking with you!reply",

I'm frequently working on something I've never done before.My most recent professional experience has been about a year at a semiconductor startup where I wrote prototypes for a compiler and a cycle simulator.One of my personal projects of ~10 years is a 3D game engine. Working on it has taught me a great deal about systems and graphics programming. It runs on Windows, Linux and Web (WASM/WebGL). I chose to build it without any libraries (barring the CRT for startup), which began as a learning exercise, but has taught me the value of simplicity.I've also been working on a metaprogramming system for C & CPP. Think templates/constexpr, but significantly more ergonomic. It turns out I have a small passion for compilers.  It currently generates many tens of thousands of lines of code for my game engine project including containers and an interactive realtime data visualization/editor.On the optimization side of things, I recently wrote the world's fastest open-source AVX2 Perlin noise implementation, and wrote about the process on my blog.  I beat the state-of-the-art by ~1.8x, which took me about two weeks.That's the cliff-notes on my technical background. As a person I'm friendly and easy to get along with. I like the phrase \"have strong opinions, weakly held\". Outside of work I enjoy surfing, backcountry skiing, snowmobiling, rock-climbing and beer!Cheers,\nJessehttps://scallywag.softwarehttps://scallywag.software/resume.htmlhttps://github.com/scallyw4gjesse@scallywag.softwarereply",

I am primarily motivated by solving problems, so let me help you solve your problems.I am open to work for a company anywhere as long as the work can be done fully remote from Africa.While I could find a job elsewhere I believe that the experience living in an area where my work is going to have an impact gives me a better understanding of the needs of the location I am serving. Whether it is through direct contact with clients and users or just by being part of a local community and learning about the reality of living there.In addition, I want to use some of my income to hire local interns and junior developers and train them in order to pass on my experience. I also sponsor children that otherwise can't afford to go to school (see my website). If you want to support this, I would love to work with you.

I've helped grow the company from inception to securing $3M in seed funding by single-handedly architecting a scalable backend infrastructure using Django, PostgreSQL, and Redis, supporting over 600,000 users with 99.9% uptime by hosting it on Kubernetes. Additionally, I designed and deployed a real-time data pipeline with Kafka and ClickHouse, enabling ingestion of 1M+ daily events. My work also included implementing advanced search capabilities (semantic + keyword based) and working on a real-time, voice based AI-powered interview platform.You can also checkout my latest project athttps://semaphore.chat. The is a chat application that offers a streamlined, no-nonsense AI chat experience. It provides access to multiple large language models (LLMs) from various vendors. Key features include markdown rendering of AI outputs, syntax highlighting for code, and the ability to display Mermaid.js diagrams on a canvas. The app supports real-time synchronization and resumable streams using Zero (sync engine), enabling users to share links, and allows for collaborative use of LLMs with peers. Authentication is handled via Google OAuth, the database is Postgres, frontend is in NextJS, self-hosted on an Hetzner server.
